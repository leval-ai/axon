# Axon - Technical Architecture

## Project Overview

Axon is a Rust library designed to provide a unified interface for connecting with Large Language Models (LLMs) that implement the OpenAI API specifications. The project is built with WebAssembly (WASM) compatibility as a core principle, enabling cross-language portability and the "code once, use everywhere" philosophy.

## Core Architecture

### Component Structure

Axon is organized as a modular, multi-crate Rust workspace:

1. **axom** - The core library that provides:
   - Common trait definitions for LLM interactions
   - Error handling and type definitions
   - Configuration management
   - WebAssembly bindings
   - Utility functions and helper methods
   
2. **axom-openai** - Implementation for OpenAI-compatible providers:
   - Direct OpenAI API integration
   - Support for compatible self-hosted models
   - Streaming and non-streaming request handling
   - API key and authentication management
   
3. **axom-anthropic** - Implementation for Anthropic's Claude models:
   - Claude-specific parameter handling
   - Message formatting and parsing
   - Anthropic API integration
   - Response handling and error management

### Key Interfaces

The core of Axon is built around several key traits:

```rust
// Conceptual interface for LLM providers
trait Provider {
    async fn complete(&self, prompt: &str, options: &Options) -> Result<Completion, Error>;
    async fn stream(&self, prompt: &str, options: &Options) -> Result<Stream<CompletionChunk>, Error>;
    // Additional provider capabilities...
}

// Conceptual interface for LLM model configurations
trait Model {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn provider(&self) -> &Provider;
    fn default_options(&self) -> Options;
    // Model-specific parameters and capabilities...
}
```

## WebAssembly Integration

Axon is designed from the ground up for WASM compatibility:

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Carefully selected dependencies that work well in WASM environments
2. **Async Support**: Full support for asynchronous operations in WASM contexts
3. **JS/TS Bindings**: Auto-generated bindings for JavaScript/TypeScript
4. **Multi-Language Support**: Framework for generating bindings for Python, Go, and other languages

## Agent Orchestration Framework

The long-term vision for Axon includes a comprehensive agent orchestration system:

1. **Agent Definitions**: Framework for defining autonomous agents with specific capabilities
2. **Tool Integration**: System for registering, discovering, and invoking tools
3. **Workflow Engine**: Orchestration of complex multi-agent workflows
4. **Memory Management**: Short and long-term memory systems for agents
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive observability into agent operations

## API Design Principles

Axon follows these core API design principles:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent interfaces across different providers
2. **Simplicity**: Simple interfaces for common use cases with advanced options where needed
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to extend for new providers and capabilities
4. **Ergonomics**: Focus on developer experience and ergonomic API design
5. **Performance**: Optimize for both speed and resource efficiency

## Deployment and Integration Models

Axon supports multiple deployment and integration scenarios:

1. **Direct Library Usage**: Use as a Rust library in Rust applications
2. **WASM in Browser**: Deploy as WASM in browser-based applications
3. **WASM in Server**: Use WASM modules in server environments
4. **Multi-Language SDKs**: Language-specific SDKs built on the WASM core

## Security Considerations

Security is a core aspect of Axon's design:

1. **API Key Management**: Secure handling of provider API keys
2. **Memory Safety**: Leveraging Rust's memory safety guarantees
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting and throttling capabilities
5. **Audit Logging**: Extensive logging for security-sensitive operations

## Performance Optimizations

Axon employs several performance optimization strategies:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse of HTTP connections
2. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent request handling where appropriate
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimizing memory allocations
4. **Streaming Processing**: Efficient handling of streaming responses
5. **Batching**: Support for batched operations where possible

## Future Capabilities

The roadmap for Axon includes:

1. **Vector Database Integration**: Built-in support for vector databases
2. **Fine-tuning Support**: API for fine-tuning models
3. **Hybrid Models**: Support for hybrid model approaches
4. **Edge Deployment**: Optimizations for edge computing scenarios
5. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
