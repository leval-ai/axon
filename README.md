> A universal library for connecting with LLMs that support the OpenAI API specifications

## Overview

Axon is a Rust-based library designed to provide a unified interface for connecting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) that support the OpenAI API specifications. Built with WebAssembly (WASM) compatibility in mind, Axon enables developers to write code once and deploy it across any language or platform that supports WASM.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Universal LLM Connectivity**: Seamlessly connect to any LLM that implements the OpenAI API specifications
- **Rust-Powered Performance**: Benefit from Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics
- **WASM Compatibility**: Use Axon in any language through WebAssembly integration
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across different LLM providers
- **Ecosystem Support**: Tools for building, agent orchestration, and more

## 🚀 Project Goals

Axon aims to build a comprehensive ecosystem around LLM applications including:

- Building tools and utilities to streamline LLM application development
- Agent orchestration frameworks for complex multi-agent systems
- Supporting infrastructure for LLM application deployment
- Cross-language compatibility through WASM
